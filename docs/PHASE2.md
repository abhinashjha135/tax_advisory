## Overview

## Phase 2 Scope

### 1. PDF Upload
- Users can upload a Pay Slip or Form 16 (PDF) via the frontend interface.
- The uploaded PDF is sent to the backend for processing.

### 2. Data Extraction
- The backend processes the uploaded PDF using:
  - `PyPDF2` for text extraction from digital PDFs.
  - `pytesseract` for OCR on scanned/image-based PDFs.
  - Google Gemini LLM to structure and validate the extracted data.
- Extracted data includes all fields required for tax calculation (see Phase 1 `UserFinancials` schema).

### 3. Data Review & Edit Form
- The frontend displays a form pre-filled with the extracted data.
- Users can review and manually edit any field before proceeding.

### 4. Tax Regime Selection
- The form includes a radio button for the user to select their preferred tax regime (Old/New).
