# Tax Advisor Application â€“ Phase 1: Project Setup, DB Schema, and Landing Page

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and deliverables for **Phase 1** of the Tax Advisor Application, as described in the master PRD. The goal of this phase is to establish the project foundation, set up the database schema, and implement a modern landing page.

## Phase 1 Scope

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialize the project repository (structure for frontend and backend).
- Set up version control (GitHub recommended).
- Prepare environment for local development (virtual environment, dependencies, etc.).

### 2. Database Schema (Supabase)
- Create the `UserFinancials` table in Supabase with the following columns:

| Column Name           | Data Type         | Description                          |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `session_id`         | UUID             | Primary Key, unique session identifier|
| `gross_salary`       | NUMERIC(15, 2)   | Total gross salary                   |
| `basic_salary`       | NUMERIC(15, 2)   | Basic salary component               |
| `hra_received`       | NUMERIC(15, 2)   | HRA received                         |
| `rent_paid`          | NUMERIC(15, 2)   | Annual rent paid                     |
| `deduction_80c`      | NUMERIC(15, 2)   | 80C investments                      |
| `deduction_80d`      | NUMERIC(15, 2)   | 80D medical insurance                |
| `standard_deduction` | NUMERIC(15, 2)   | Standard deduction                   |
| `professional_tax`   | NUMERIC(15, 2)   | Professional tax paid                |
| `tds`                | NUMERIC(15, 2)   | Tax Deducted at Source               |
| `created_at`         | TIMESTAMPTZ      | Record creation timestamp            |

- Ensure the table is accessible from the backend (Python, psycopg2).

### 3. Landing Page
- Implement a modern, branded landing page as the application's entry point.
- Design requirements:
  - Clean, light theme with blue highlights.
  - Use "Aptos Display" font for typography.
  - Prominent "Start" button to begin the user flow.
  - Responsive and visually appealing layout.
